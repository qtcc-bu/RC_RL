# RC_RL: Reservoir Computing for Reinforcement Learning 
This project is a vanilla implementation of Deep-Q Learning algorithm using Reservoir Computing. It uses the code here: https://github.com/ritakurban/Practical-Data-Science/ as a framework for implementation. 

More details about the project, reservoir computing and why it matters for Reinforcement Learning can be found in the included paper. Also included is the powerpoint given during the class, which has some supplementary information. 

This was done as the project component of EC 700: Reinforcement Learning, taught by Dr. Alexander Olshevsky at Boston University, in the Spring of 2023.
