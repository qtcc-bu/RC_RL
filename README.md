# RC_RL: Reservoir Computing for Reinforcement Learning 
This project is a vanilla implementation of Deep-Q Learning algorithm using Reservoir Computing. It uses the code here: https://github.com/ritakurban/Practical-Data-Science/ as a framework for implementation. 

More details about the proeject, reservoir computing and why it matters for Reinforcement Learning can be found in the included paper. 

This project was done as part of the project component of EC700: Reinforcement Learning, taught by Dr. Alex Olshevsky at Boston University, in the spring of 2023.
